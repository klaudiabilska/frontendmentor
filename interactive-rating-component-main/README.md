I had no idea how to use JS in projects like this. Actually this was my first project whit mix of JS, HTML and CSS. I'm proud lol. 

Tbh, I did it with YT tutorial, but still I feel like i I'm doing well.

I know how to alpha in rbga works.
Also I learned how to set letter (line) spacing: 

```css

}
```
